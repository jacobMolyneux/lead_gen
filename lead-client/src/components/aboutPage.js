            <h1>How it Works</h1>
            <p>Gathering Leads is a pain. I made this site to make getting leads much faster. Last time that I checked, this prtogram can gather 150 leads in 1 minute.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>How to Use It</h1>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Create a lead list on LinkedIn</p>
        <p>The lead list should look something like this. If you dont have a lead list then the program will not work</p>
        <p> Once you have create a lead list go the first page of the lead list and copy the URL. Paste the url into the form on the page <a href = '/'>here.</a></p>

        <h3>Enter your username and password for linkedin. Dont worry this information is never saved and we will never see it.</h3>

        <p>enter your email. When the scrape is completed a file will be sent to your email with the leads that you can use.</p>
